\section*{Dissertation}
\years{Title}\emph{Joint Action and Communication, With a Focus on Demonstratives} \\
\years{Summary}There is a tension between accounting for the rationality of things we do---explaining our actions as sensible activities for us to engage in, and not just as, say, reflexes---but at the same time do so in a way that is empirically and introspectively responsible. The goal of my dissertation is to account for the rationality of special kinds of human joint engagement---things we do together---and to do so without overintellectualization. The two special kinds of joint engagement I address are joint attention and linguistic communication, and with the latter I focus on demonstratives (e.g. ``this'' and ``that'').
