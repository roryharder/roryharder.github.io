My name is <b>Rory Harder</b>. I am currently completing my PhD in philosophy at the University of Toronto. My main research interests are in the philosophy of language and mind, and epistemology, with a focus on the meaning and use of demonstratives.

Here is my <a href="RH_FULLCV.pdf">CV</a>.

# Teaching

As a course instructor, I have taught a third-year seminar on <a href="rh-mind-syllabus.pdf">perception</a> at the University of Toronto and a first-year <a href="syllabus.pdf">introduction to formal reasoning and decision making</a> at Rutgers University.

As a teaching assistant at the University of Toronto, I have run tutorials for second-year courses on metaphysics and epistemology, ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy, and probability theory; and a first-year introduction to philosophy course.
