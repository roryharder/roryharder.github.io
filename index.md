My name is Rory Harder. I am a philosophy PhD student at the University of Toronto. My main research interests are in philosophy of language and mind, and epistemology. My dissertation is on the meaning and use of demonstratives.

Here is my [CV](https://RH_FULLCV.pdf).

# Teaching

As a course instructor, I have taught a third-year seminar on the philosophy of mind and a first-year introduction to formal reasoning and decision-making.

As a teaching assistant, I have run tutorials and graded for second-year courses on metaphysics and epistemology, ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy, and probability theory; and a first-year introduction to philosophy course.

I worked for two years as a philosophy tutor (and residence assistant) at Trinity College in the University of Toronto.
