My name is <b>Rory Harder</b>. I am currently completing my PhD in philosophy at the University of Toronto, with a defense expected in March 2022.

My main research interests are in the philosophy of language and mind. I am concerned with linguistic communication, in particular the formal semantics and pragmatics of demonstratives, and more generally the ways in which we interact.

<a href="rh-cv.pdf">Here</a> is my CV.

You can e-mail me at [firstname][lastname]@gmail.com.

# Papers

* Joint Attention and Communication, *Accepted at Inquiry*
* [A paper on the formal semantics of demonstratives], *Revise and Resubmit*
* Clearing up Clouds: Underspecification in Demonstrative Communication, *In Preparation*
