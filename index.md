My name is <b>Rory Harder</b>. I am currently completing my PhD in philosophy at the University of Toronto. My main research interests are in the philosophy of language and mind, with a focus on the meaning and use of demonstratives.

<a href="rh-cv.pdf">Here</a> is my CV, where my e-mail may be found.

# Research

I am giving a talk on joint attention at the Pacific APA in early April 2021.

I have several papers under review, and I preparing one on what's involved in demonstrative understanding.

# Teaching

I have taught third-year seminars on <a href="rh-mind-syllabus.pdf">perception</a> and <a href="fpsyll.pdf">Frege's puzzle</a> at the University of Toronto and first-year <a href="syllabus.pdf">introduction to formal reasoning and decision making</a> at Rutgers University.

<!-- As a teaching assistant at the University of Toronto, I have run tutorials for second-year courses on metaphysics and epistemology, ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy, and probability theory; and a first-year introduction to philosophy course. -->
