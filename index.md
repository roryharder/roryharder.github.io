# Teaching

As a course instructor, I have taught a third-year seminar on the philosophy of mind at the University of Toronto and a first-year introduction to formal reasoning and decision-making at Rutgers University.

As a teaching assistant at the University of Toronto, I have run tutorials and graded for second-year courses on metaphysics and epistemology, ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy, and probability theory; and a first-year introduction to philosophy course.
