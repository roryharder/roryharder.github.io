My name is <b>Rory Harder</b>. I am currently completing my PhD in philosophy at the University of Toronto, with a defense expected in March 2022.

My main research interests are in the philosophy of language and mind. I am concerned with linguistic communication, in particular the formal semantics and pragmatics of demonstratives, and more generally the ways in which we interact.

# Papers

* Joint Attention and Communication, *Accepted at Inquiry*

  Joint attention occurs when two (or more) individuals attend together to some object. It has been identified by psychologists as an early form of our joint engagement, and is thought to provide us with an understanding of other minds that is basic in that sophisticated conceptual resources are not involved. Accordingly, it has also attracted the interest of philosophers. A very recent trend in the psychological and philosophical literature on joint attention consists of developing the suggestion that it holds partially in virtue of communication: it is because we share our thoughts or feelings about an object that our individual attention to it becomes joint. This paper unpacks the communicative suggestion in a way that accounts for joint attention's basicness.
