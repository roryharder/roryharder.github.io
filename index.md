My name is <b>Rory Harder</b>. That's a picture of me atop a mountain in Poland!

As of September 2025, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Collège de France as a part of François Recanati's <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ercmentalfiles/home">project on mental files</a>. Before that I did a postdoctoral fellowship at the University College Dublin School of Philosophy, and before that I completed my PhD in philosophy at the University of Toronto in 2022.
