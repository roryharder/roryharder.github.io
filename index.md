My name is <b>Rory Harder</b>. I am currently completing my PhD in philosophy at the University of Toronto. My main research interests are in the philosophy of language and mind, with a focus on the meaning and use of demonstratives.

Here is my <a href="rh-cv.pdf">CV</a>, where my e-mail may be found.
