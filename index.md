My name is <b>Rory Harder</b>. I am currently completing my PhD in philosophy at the University of Toronto. My main research interests are in the philosophy of language and mind, with a focus on the meaning and use of demonstratives.

<a href="rh-cv.pdf">Here</a> is my CV, where my e-mail may be found.

# Research

I am giving a talk on joint attention at the Pacific APA in early April 2021, with comments from John Campbell and Johannes Roessler.

Here are some papers I am working on. Feel free to e-mail me for drafts. Any comments are appreciated!

* [under review]

* Salience and Deixis in the Anaphora Resolution of Demonstratives and Definite Descriptions (in preparation)

* Clearing up Clouds: Underspecification in Demonstrative Communication (in preparation)

* Understanding Demonstratives Together (in preparation)

# Teaching

I have taught third-year seminars on <a href="rh-mind-syllabus.pdf">perception</a> and <a href="fpsyll.pdf">Frege's puzzle</a> at the University of Toronto and first-year <a href="syllabus.pdf">introduction to formal reasoning and decision making</a> at Rutgers University.

<!-- As a teaching assistant at the University of Toronto, I have run tutorials for second-year courses on metaphysics and epistemology, ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy, and probability theory; and a first-year introduction to philosophy course. -->
