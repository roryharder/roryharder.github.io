I have taught first-year introductions to philosophy and upper-year seminars on the philosophy of mind and language at the University of Toronto, and first-year introductions to formal reasoning and decision-making at Rutgers University.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like to see my teaching dossier, which includes details of my teaching experience, sample syllabi, and student evaluations.
