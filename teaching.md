# Teaching

I have taught first-year introductions to philosophy and upper-year seminars on the philosophy of mind and language at the University of Toronto. I have taught first-year introductions to formal reasoning and decision-making at Rutgers University.

<a href="rh-teachingstatement.pdf">Here</a> is a statement of my teaching philosophy, which includes details of my teaching experience.

<!-- I have taught third-year seminars on <a href="rh-mind-syllabus.pdf">perception</a> and <a href="fpsyll.pdf">Frege's puzzle</a> at the University of Toronto and a first-year <a href="syllabus.pdf">introduction to formal reasoning and decision making</a> at Rutgers University. -->

<!-- As a teaching assistant at the University of Toronto, I have run tutorials for second-year courses on metaphysics and epistemology, ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy, and probability theory; and a first-year introduction to philosophy course. -->
